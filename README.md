# Project Neighbor

This fangame, as always did in previous versions, aims to recover the old alpha **feeling** of Hello Neighbor (Wow, how original!) with my own additions that makes the game, in my opinion, better in many aspects.

I'm not here to sacrifice quality in exchange of old HN vibes only; let's leave that for 1:1 recreations. Old alphas had very poor quality even when being better than newer releases, and i want something better built over the same "feeling", not the whole bad quality vibe.
I'm not here to tell you a whole custom story; the idea of old HN feeling was that the story was cryptic and mysterious, even incomplete if you wanna say.
I'm not here to make you "play my game, experience my cool game!"; this is a more "sandbox" experience, which can be truly fun to play instead of just being a boring "solve my cool custom puzzles" fangame. If the player doesn't like a feature, they can disable it, i won't force you to play with stuff that doens't fit your needs, or doesnt fit the old ahestetic you want to revive. (I hate weird twisted fangames that claims reviving the "old feeling" and they only end up making unfitting random stuff)

## The Repository

This is the open repository for the whole project. Remember that setting it up isn't always 100% perfect and may throw a plenty of errors.
May i someday make a tutorial on how to use this like if it were a "baseproject"? Only time knows.

Be aware that this is made around the way 'I' find more optimized (and secondarily comfortable) to work, so don't expect easy stuff and short code. My project is thought to be really long term and not just a simple fun project; it't meant to train me for future and way more important projects than a HN fangame.
Don't. Expect. Simple. Stuff.
### Flexibility > Simplicity

Use this as base for your fangames or even separated projects; but if you use it, please give credit, it's always very appreciated...
About forks, ehh... I'm leaving this repo here for boosting the community, assuming everybody has good enough ethics for working, so you get it. (Also i plan on this game being moddeable so don't make forks with the excuse of "i want my custom content in" pls)
